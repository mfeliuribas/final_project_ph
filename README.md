+ **data**: a folder with the raw and tidy data in csv file format, plus the subsets created for the analysis
+ **flyer**: a folder with the flyers created to recruit participants

    + **includes**: bibliography and figures of the models (some of them are included in the manuscript, while others were deleted due to space limitations)
    + **notes**: notes and previous documents with information used in the final manuscript
+ **papers**: a folder with previous studies that could inform the background literature section
